# Password Security
---

## Randomness
1. Web sites and apps try to enforce password security by promoting randomness in passwords
1. Minimum length, upper and lower case, numbers, special characters
1. Ideally, your passwords should look like this
    `d4qz&-5Tkjz-8skb`
1. Do your passwords look like that?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Reality Check
1. Good random passwords are hard to remember
1. Many people choose memorable passwords<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    1. Names of children or pets
    1. Birthdates or anniversaries
    1. Favorite movies, singers, athletes

---

## Password Hacking

1. If an attacker can get a list of scrambled passwords, it's 
straightforward to try common combinations
1. Common substitutions are easily defeated, like g!@nts1
1. We will use what we've learned about C strings to
explore password security

---

## Entropy

1. Entropy measures disorder, uncertainty, or randomness
1. Bigger entropy numbers mean more random
1. We will measure entropy to show how to choose a good password

---

## Counting Combinations

1. If a character string is made of only lower-case letters 
then each character has 26 combinations
1. If the string is four characters long, then the possible combinations 
are 26 * 26 * 26 * 26, or 26^4, or 456,976

---

## Bits of Entropy

1. By counting the number of bits in a binary number, we can approximate 
the number of guesses an attacker would have to make to crack a password
1. In our example, 456,976 is in between 2^18 (262,144) and
2^19 (524,288)

---

## Logarithm Review

1. log10(10) = 10^ what?
1. log10(100) = 10^ what?
1. log2(4) = 2^ what?
1. log2(262,144) = 2^ what?

=> We can use C log() to calculate entropy!<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## For Project01

1. We can find the exact power of 2 using the C `log()` function (base 10)
1. log2(456,976) = log(456,976) / log(2) = 18.802 to three decimal places
1. For our project, we will call this 18 bits of entropy

---

## How Much Is Enough?

1. We want enough entropy so that it would be impractical
to try all the combinations by brute force
1. 70-80 bits is good but with enough hardware attacking 
your password, it's just a matter of time
1. Passphrases of five memorable words provide excellent entropy. Why?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Password Hygiene

1. Don't use a dictionary word or simple transformations
1. Use a different password for different sites. Why?
1. Password Managers can be helpful
1. Two factor authentication: something you have and
something you know
