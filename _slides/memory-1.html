# Memory, part 1

## What is "memory" anyway?

Memory is electrical circuitry in which each value stored has a unique 
"address" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Real-world: every apartment in your building has an address (e.g. room 302)
 and a value stored at that address (you) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Memory is an array of values

| Address | Value |
| --- | --- |
| 4294967295 | 0 |
| ... | ... |
| 2   | 255 |
| 1   | 42 |
| 0   | 37 |

---

## What kind of values?

Numbers, between 0 and 255 <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

One "byte" of information <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Larger numbers are stored in multiple consecutive bytes <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
