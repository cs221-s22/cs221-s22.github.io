# Game Theory

# minimax
---
## Problem Domain
1. Minimax is an algorithm for programming games which:
    - Have turn-by-turn game play of two players
    - Have a winner and a loser ("zero sum")
    - Utilize pieces on a board, like Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Go, Mancala, etc.
---
## Why "minimax"?
1. Every possible move is assigned a point value
1. In a zero-sum game, what's good for player 1 is bad for player 2, and vice versa
1. When it's the maximizer's turn, minimax chooses the move with the highest value
1. When it's the minimizer's turn, minimax chooses the move with the lowest value
---
## How does it work?
1. Minimax plays out all possible game moves
    - until win, lose, or draw ("terminal state")
1. The maximizer and the minimizer each play their best possible move
1. Properly implemented, minimax is difficult to beat
    - Games should end in a draw
    - Minimax is not probabilistic, like games of chance
---
## Pseudocode
```
function minimax(node, depth, maximizingPlayer) is
    if depth = 0 or node is a terminal node then
        return the heuristic value of node
    if maximizingPlayer then
        value := −∞
        for each child of node do
            value := max(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, FALSE))
        return value
    else (* minimizing player *)
        value := +∞
        for each child of node do
            value := min(value, minimax(child, depth − 1, TRUE))
        return value
```

2. Tip: use your lab04 code to calculate "terminal" conditions like win, lose, draw.

## C tips 1
1. This is a classic problem, so implementations are available. You must write your own code
---
## C tips 2
C doesn't have "infinity" , but you can use C's `INT_MAX` and `INT_MIN` macros
```c
#include < limits.h>
#include < sys/param.h>
...
int n = MAX(INT_MAX, min);
int m = MIN(INT_MIN, max);
/* #define MIN(a,b) (((a)<(b))?(a):(b)) */
```
---
## C tips 3a
You can return a `struct` by value
```c
typedef struct _move {
    int row;
    int col;
} move; 
move find_best_move() {
    move m = {0, 0};
    ...
    return m;
}
```
---
## C tips 3b
or pass a pointer to a `struct` if you prefer
```c
typedef struct _move {
    int row;
    int col;
} move; 
void find_best_move(move *pmove) {
    pmove->row = 0;
    pmove->col = 0;
}
```
