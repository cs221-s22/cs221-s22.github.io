# Shell introduction

1. The shell (`sh`) is the program which interprets your commands

1. Conventionally, `sh` uses `$` as a prompt for your next command

___
## Print working directory

1. The directories in the filesystem form a tree. To see which 
directory we're currently working in
    ```sh
    $ pwd
    /home/phpheterson
    ```
1. Shows that we're in my home directory. The home directory is abbreviated with the tilde character (`~`)

___
## Change directory

1. To change the working directory
    ```sh
    $ cd foo
    ```
1. Now we're in `/home/phpeterson/foo` or `~/foo`

___
## List directory contents

1. To list the files and directories contained in the working directory
    ```sh
    $ ls
    afile adirectory
    ```

___
## Manual pages

If you don't know how to use a command, the online manual can help you

```sh
$ man ls
NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List  information  about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort
       entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
...
```

# Secure shell (ssh)

1. `ssh` runs a shell session on another computer on the network

```sh
$ ssh phpeterson@stargate.cs.usfca.edu
```

2. Now I'm running as the user phpeterson on the host (computer) named
`stargate.cs.usfca.edu`

___
## user@host

1. The shell has a special variable called `PS1` which shows the user and host

2. You can customize `PS1` by editing `~/.bashrc` and then running 
    ```sh
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ```
to force the shell to reevaluate `PS1`
___
## Public and Private Keys

1. ssh uses the same [Public Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) that https uses to secure web browsing

1. PKI can provide both authentication and encryption

1. PKI uses a "public key" and a "private key" which together comprise an "key pair"

___
## Encryption

1. A user Bob has a public key and a private key. He sends his public key to another user, Alice

1. Alice has a public key and a private key. She sends her public key to Bob

1. Bob can compute a new secret using his private key and Alice's public key

1. Alice can compute the same secret using her private key and Bob's public key
___
## Key Exchange

1. Now that Bob and Alice share a secret which was not transmitted, they
can use that secret to exchange encryption keys securely.

___
## Authentication

1. Another useful characteristic of the "handshake" is that Alice can
prove that she knows her private key without revealing its value

1. Therefore stealing the value of a private key could allow one person 
to impersonate another

1. Protect your private key with a good passphrase

# Version control using git
___
## Git

1. `git` is a program which calculates the changes to a file from
one version of the file to the next

1. The database of such changes is called a "repository"

1. In the professional world, everyone uses `git` to track 
    1. which changes are included in a software release
    1. when a bug was introduced by an incorrect change
___
## Making changes

1. If you edit `foo.c` you can
    ```sh
    $ git commit -m"fix a bug" foo.c
    ```
    and your source code change is committed to the "local repo"

___
## Checking for uncommitted changes

1. You can get a list of uncommitted changes using
    ```sh
    $ git status
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    nothing to commit, working tree clean
    ```
___
## Distributed version control

1. Your local repo can be synchronized with a "remote repo"

1. To sync changes in your local repo to the remote
    ```sh
    $ git push
    ```

1. To sync changes from a remote repo to your local repo
    ```sh
    $ git pull
    ```
___
## Github

1. We will use [github.com](https://github.com) to submit assignments for grading

1. Set up authentication to github using your public key

1. Be careful to commit and push your changes to get credit for your work

1. Teams of programmers collaborate on projects this way

---
# Editors

1. I strongly suggest you use an editor with syntax highlighting

1. vi/vim are terminal-mode editors available on all Linux environments

1. The [micro editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/) is also available, and 
uses more familiar keyboard shortcuts
