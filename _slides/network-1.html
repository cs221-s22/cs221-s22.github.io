# Intro to Networking

## Computers can communicate with each other
- But how, exactly?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What services are provided? How do they work?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How can C programmers utilize these services?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## History
- There have been many HW/SW systems for networking
- Even a [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) for describing network systems
- Today, the Internet Protocol Suite ([TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite)) is the dominant *transport protocol*
- *Application protocols* are built on top of TCP
---
## Interfaces
- Every *interface* (Ethernet port, USB port, or WiFi card/chip) has a physical [MAC address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)
- MAC addresses never change
- To communicate on a network, an interface must have a logical IP address
- Network routers map physical MAC addresses to logical IP addresses
---
## What is an IP address?
- An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, written as 4 one-byte sequences (*octets*), e.g. `10.0.1.2`
- IP addresses must be unique on a network
- System admins may give their computers a *static IP address* if they wish
- Network routers lease a *dynamic IP address* to an interface using [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol)
---
## IP address range
- 2^32 (about 4.3 billion) addresses is not that big a number
- Today, IPv4 addresses are rationed and leases can be short
- IPv6 uses 2^128 addresses for a lot more range, e.g. `fe80::5054:ff:fed3:28f0`
- Within the lab network, we will use only IPv4 addresses
---
## Loopback Addresses
- Programs can connect to their own computer (*host*) using the loopback address
- By convention, the IPv4 loopback is `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` and the IPv6 loopback is `::1`
---
## Public vs. Private Addresses
- By convention, the IPv4 ranges `10.x.y.z` and `192.168.x.y` are *private network addresses*
- IPv6 addresses beginning with `fe80::` are private network addresses
- Network routers hand out those addresses via [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) autoconfiguration

## Transport Protocols
- UDP: Datagrams
- TCP: Streams (a.k.a. *sessions*)
- What's the difference?
---
## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- "Fire and forget"
- No guarantees about delivery, order of delivery
- No error handling or retransmission
---
## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- Creates a *session* using sequence numbers
- Sessions guarantee delivery and order
- Handles errors and retransmission
---
## Application Protocols
- DNS maps *host/domain names* to IP addresses
- HTTP delivers hypertext ([HTML](https://www.w3.org/)) documents
- Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF](https://www.ietf.org/)) standardizes many protocols
---
## Ports
- Once we have an address and a protocol, we need a *port*
- Ports are 16-bit integers (0 - 32,767)
- Port numbers < 1024 are standardized by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority ([IANA](https://www.iana.org/))
---
## Network Byte Order
- Different computer architectures store integers in different formats
- *Big endian* means that `0xAABBCCDD` is stored in memory as `0xAA`, `0xBB`, `0xCC`, `0xDD`
- *Little endian* means it's stored as `0xDD`, `0xCC`, `0xBB`, `0xAA`
- By convention, IP networks [transmit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Networking) multi-byte integers in Big Endian format
